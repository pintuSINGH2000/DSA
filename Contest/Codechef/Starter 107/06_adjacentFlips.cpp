// Problem
// You are given a binary string S of length N.

// You can perform the following operation on it:

// Choose an index i (1â‰¤i<N) such that S(i)=S(i+1) and flip both S(i) and S(i+1).
// Flipping S(i) means it becomes 1 if it was originally 0, and vice versa.
// For example, if S=0101100, performing the operation with 
// i=4 would result in S=0100000 and performing it with i=6 would result in S=0101111 .

// By performing this operation several (possibly, zero) times,
// is it possible to make S contain only a single type of character (that is, S should contain either all zeros or all ones)?
