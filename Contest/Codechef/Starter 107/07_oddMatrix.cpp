// Problem
// You are given an integer N.

// Your task is to construct a matrix of size NÃ—N satisfying all the following conditions:

// All elements are between 1 and N^2;
// All elements are pairwise distinct;
// The sum of elements in every row is odd;
// The sum of elements in every column is odd.
// It can be shown that under the given constraints, at least one such matrix exists for every N.

// If there are multiple answers, you may print any.
